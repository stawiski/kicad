These are my KiCad libraries.

I've divided them into the categories by the manufacturer/purpose or just generic.
Manufacturer category trumps purpose category.
I made it this way not to have too many directories with parts from manufacturers I use rarely.
For example, there are many connector manufacturers and I use them interchangeably, so there's just one directory for connectors.

Enjoy,
